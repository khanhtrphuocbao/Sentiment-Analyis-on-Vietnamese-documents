# Abstract
Aspect-based sentiment analysis is a complex task that plays an important role in natural language processing (NLP). However, recent studies have mainly focused on aspect detection and sentiment classification, overlooking the subtask of user opinion span detection, which has great potential in practical applications. In this paper, we conduct experiments on the UIT-ViSD4SA dataset. We propose using the PhoBERT model for contextual feature extraction and combining it with the BiLSTM-CRF model for the task of opinion span detection and sentiment extraction. The PhoBERTv2 model with word segmentation achieves the highest F1-score of 51%.
